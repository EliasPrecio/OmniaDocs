Process Viewer
===========================

The Process viewer control is available as a web part for legacy pages and as a block for Quick Pages.

This control is used to display the process for end users, where they can navigate, read the description, linked documents and more. 

Here's an example:

**Note!** This control is best suited to the main part of the page. It will need space.

Settings for the control
*************************
The settings are organized in four tabs, see the sections below.

The Custom Colors tab
-----------------------
You should primarily set colors through Theme colors in Omnia Admin (System/Settings/Default colors). If you still would like custom colors for the control, you can set them using this tab.

Templates
===========================

It's possible to create a Process Site Template from a process. The template can then be used to create team sites the normal way. Documents linked to the list of actions will then be set up in the team site created from the template.

To select a process as the template, use the option "Process Site Template" on the "Advanced" tab in the Processes library.

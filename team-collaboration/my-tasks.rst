 
My Tasks
########
The My Tasks Control aggregates all tasks that have been assigned to the current user from all team sites. 

**Note!** The My Tasks Control is based on the search engine in SharePoint. It may take several minutes before a task assigned to the current user in a team site is shown on the start page.

All sites with tasks assigned to the user is displayed in a list, with the number of tasks assigned in each site. 

The My taskslist is often part of the Notification panel but can also be added as a separate control, as a web part on a legacy page, or a block on a Quick Page.

Announcements
===========================

The Announcements Control aggregates the latest non expired announcements that the user has read access to. 

Note! The Announcements Control is based on the search engine in SharePoint. It may take several minutes before an announcement created in a team site is shown on the start page.

Announcements is often a part of the Notification Panel, for example:

Announcements can also be added as a separate control.

Important announcements, the messages, are created and edited through Omnia Admin, see: :doc:`Important Announcements <OminaDocs/web-content-management/news/important-announcements/index>`

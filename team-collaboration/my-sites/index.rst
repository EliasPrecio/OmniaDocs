My Sites
===========================

The My sites control makes it possible for the end user to navigate to all sites that the user has access to.

The My sites quick search makes it possible for the end user to find sites, that the user has access to, based on any of the following base templates:

+ Team Site (STS#0)
+ Document Workspace (STS#2)
+ Project Site (PROJECTSITE#O)
+ Blog (BLOG#0)
+ Community Site (COMMUNITY#0)
+ Wiki Site (WIKI#0)

Four tabs can be available in the control:

+ **FOLLOWING**: Lists all sites that the user are following.
+ **LAST VISITED**: Lists the sites the user has visited recently.
+ **MEMBER OF**: Lists all sites the user is member of (has member access to).
+ **ALL**: Can be used to serch for any site, available for the user.

The user can follow a site by clicking the "Follow site" icon, the plus, in the search result or the Last visited or Member of lists. 
The user can stop following a site by clicking the "Stop following site" icon, the minus, in any of the lists. 

Two things will happen when a user follows a site:

+ The site will be available as a quick link in the "Follwing" list in the My sites control.
+ Any conversations in the newsfeed on the site will be available in the user feed on the start page, in the "Following" tab.

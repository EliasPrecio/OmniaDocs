My Sites
===========================

The My sites control makes it possible for the end user to navigate to all sites that the user has access to.

Using the My sites quick search the user can find sites that the user has access to, based on any of the following base templates:

+ Team Site (STS#0)
+ Document Workspace (STS#2)
+ Project Site (PROJECTSITE#O)
+ Blog (BLOG#0)
+ Community Site (COMMUNITY#0)
+ Wiki Site (WIKI#0)

Four tabs can be available in the control:

+ **FOLLOWING**: Lists all sites that the user are following.
+ **LAST VISITED**: Lists the sites the user has visited recently.
+ **MEMBER OF**: Lists all sites the user is member of (has member access or owner access to).
+ **ALL**: Can be used to serch for any site, available for the user.

The user can follow or unfollow a site by clicking the star, in the search result or the Last visited or Member of lists. A grey star indicates that the site is not followed and a black or colored star indicates that the user follows the site. 

Two things will happen when a user follows a site:

+ The site will be available as a quick link in the "Follwing" list in the My sites control.
+ Any conversations in the newsfeed on the site will be available in the user feed on the start page.

My Sites
===========================

The My sites control makes it possible for the end user to navigate to all sites that the user has access to.

.. image:: my-sites-b-new2.png

Using the My sites quick search the user can find sites that the user has access to, based on any of the following base templates:

+ Team Site (STS#0)
+ Document Workspace (STS#2)
+ Project Site (PROJECTSITE#O)
+ Blog (BLOG#0)
+ Community Site (COMMUNITY#0)
+ Wiki Site (WIKI#0)

Four tabs can be available in the control:

+ **FOLLOWING**: Lists all sites that the user are following.
+ **LAST VISITED**: Lists the sites the user has visited recently.
+ **MEMBER OF**: Lists all sites the user is member of (has member access or owner access to).
+ **ALL**: Can be used to serch for any site, available for the user.

The user can follow or unfollow a site by clicking the star, in the search result or the Last visited or Member of lists. A grey star indicates that the site is not followed and a black or colored star indicates that the user follows the site. 

Two things will happen when a user follows a site:

+ The site will be available as a quick link in the "Follwing" list in the My sites control.
+ Any conversations in the newsfeed on the site will be available in the user feed on the start page.

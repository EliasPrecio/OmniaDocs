Last Updated Documents
======================

The Latest Documents control (also called Last Updated Documents) aggregates all documents that have been recently modified from all sites the user is following. 

Note! The Latest Documents control is based on the search engine in SharePoint. It may take several minutes before an updated document is shown on the start page.

Latest Documents is often displayed in the Notification Panel, for example:

The General tab
----------------
On this tab you can set the following:

+ **Row Limit**: The maximum number of documents to show in the list.
+ **Day Limit**: The number of days back to get updated documents based on their modified date.
+ **Use direct file link**: If you would like the document to always be opened in the full version of application (the version installed on the computer, not the web version), check this box.
+ **View**: Select to view the announcements in a single list, in time order or grouped by site.
+ **Icon**: Select how to display the icons for the document type, Sketched (black and white) or Image (color).

The Custom Colors tab
------------------------
You should primarily set colors through Theme colors in Omnia Admin (System/Settings/Default colors). If you still would like custom colors for the control, you can set them using this tab.

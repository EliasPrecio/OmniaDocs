Last Updated Documents
======================

The Latest Documents control (also called Last Updated Documents) aggregates all documents that have been recently modified from all sites the user is following. 

Note! The Latest Documents control is based on the search engine in SharePoint. It may take several minutes before an updated document is shown on the start page.

Latest Documents is often displayed in the Notification Panel, for example:

Latest Documents can also be added as a separate control.

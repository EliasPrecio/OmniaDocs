Cross Site Header
===========================

The Omnia Cross Sites Header is shown in all sites in the tenant and it's where the main menu, the logo (which can be used to go back to the start page), Quick Search, and other options like My Links and My Sites can be found. It's based on a master navigation term set in the main publishing portal of the tenant. Here's an example:

The settings
-------------
The following settings are availble:

+ **Background Color** and **Icon Color**: You should primarily set colors through Theme colors in Omnia Admin (System/Settings/Default colors). If you still would like custom colors for the header, you can set background color and icon color here.
+ **Enable Legacy Header**: If you for some reason would like to use the Sharepoint standard header instead, select this option. Note that this option removes the Omnia Cross Site Header from ALL sites.

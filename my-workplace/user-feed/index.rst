+ **Default height**: Set the default height in pixels. When there is more to display in the list, a "Show more" button is shown (see image at the top of the page).
+ **Custum colors**: You should primarily set colors through Theme colors in Omnia Admin (System/Settings/Default colors). If you still would like custom colors for the control, you can set them using this tab.

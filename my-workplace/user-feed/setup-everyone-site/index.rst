Setup Everyone Site
===========================

To be able to post to all people in an organization, you need to configure an "Everyone Site" for the user feed.
You can set up a new site in SharePoint for this, but the recommended setup is to use the main publishing site in your intranet.
Follow these steps to do this.

1. Go to the start page of the main publishing site.
#. Go to Site Settings > Site Features.
#. Activate the SharePoint feature "Site Feed".
#. Go to Site Contents.
#. Go to the Settings of the MicroFeed list.
#. Go to Permissions for this list.
#. Click on Stop Inheriting Permissions.
#. Change the permissions on the Visitor group from Read to Contribute.
#. Configure the user feed block on the start page to use the main publishing site as the Everyone Site.

Controlled Documents Subscription
=================================

This block is used to display notifications for Controlled Documents the logged in user subscribes to, and to make it easier for the user to add additional subscriptions. The block can be added to any page but is really meant to be part of the Notification Panel.

Here's an example on detailed settings to display notification about Product Manuals for the Citybike Cruising:

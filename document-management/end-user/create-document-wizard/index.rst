Create Document Wizard
===========================

The Omnia Create New Document Wizard can be used in any site in the tenant, to create new documents, both Controlled Documents and "normal" documents, based on templates set up in the Document Management Settings. Regarding Controlled Documents a new document can even be base on any published Controlled Document.

When this Site feature ("Omnia Document Management Create Document Wizard") is activated for a site, the Omnia Wizard replaces the standard options for "New" in classic document libraries and "Add" in "Controlled Documents" libraries.

The Wizard works slightly differently for Controlled Documents and for "normal" documents. Here's an example when used for normal documents:

The available templates are shown to the left. In the middle a location (Document Library) to save the new template in is selected, default is the site where the wizard was started. To the far right a folder in the chosen library can be selected.

This means any user can use the wizard from any site where the feature is activated to create a document, and save it in the Documents library in any other site that user has access to.

Here's an example when used for Controlled Documents:

First the author selects type of document to create. When that is done it can look as above and the next steps are to add properties, select template (there can be several for each type), type a name for the document and select location, which in this case can be Controlled Documents libraries only.

Controlled Documents Viewer
===========================

The Omnia Controlled Documents Viewer can be used on any publishing page to make certain controlled documents available for users. The control can even be used several times on the same page, for different lists of controlled documents.

Access permissions apply, a user can never be able to read a controlled document he or she does not have permission to read. The system takes care of that. Reading access is handled in the permission group that is called something like "Readers of controlled documents", in group sites where controlled documents are published.

The Omnia Controlled Documents Viewer can be added and edited by any editor that has edit access to the page.

Here's an example of a list of controlled documents, using the Controlled Documents Viewer:

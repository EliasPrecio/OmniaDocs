Documents Bulk Update
===========================

Use this option to bulk update any of the defined document management properties. One example could be if a colleague will no longer be document owner for a number of documents. With this option you can easily replace that name with another. Note that not all properties can be replaced, for example Approver. 

+ Start by selecting property, add the property value to be replaced, and then click "Find".

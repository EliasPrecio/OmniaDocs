Notes on upgrading Document Management
========================================

When upgrading Document Management to Omnia for Microsoft 365 you must be aware that Document Managment (as well as Process Management) now uses Single Part App Page to display the controlled documents and process library respectively. No other web parts can be added to the page.

You can find more information on this Microsoft page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/single-part-app-pages?tabs=pnpposh

This means that additions that eventual extra web parts carried in Omnia for Sharepoint must be added som other way.

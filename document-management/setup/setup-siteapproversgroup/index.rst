3. Check the box "Use Site Approvers Group" and select a name for the group. Note! It is possible to use the placeholder {SiteName} if you want the name of the team site to be included in the name.
4. If you have team sites already setup, you have to upgrade the feature "Omnia Document Management Authoring Site" on each team site.
5. Validate that a site approvers SharePoint Group has been created on the team sites respectively and add people to the group if relevant.
6. Go to Omnia Admin > Document Management > Document Types and configure the document types that should use the approvers group publishing option.

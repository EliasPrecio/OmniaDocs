Controlled Documents Library
===========================

When a group site has been set up for Controlled Documents authoring, the following will be available for Controlled Document authors:

+ A documents library (Controlled Documents) that only users defined in the author’s permission group can work with.
+ A Send for Comments Workflow.
+ A Publish Workflow.
+ A Tasks list.
+ Workflow History.
+ Document History for drafts.
+ Document History for the published editions.
+ Options for relating to other documents.
+ Options for relating to QMS Processes (if Omnia QMS is installed).
+ Options for creating a new draft from a published document.
+ Options for unpublishing a published document.

In the Controlled Documents library, authors can find three tabs:

"Drafts" is used when creating and editing drafts for new Controlled Documents or when updating an existing document for a new edition.

"Tasks" is a list of tasks for the documents – either for review or for publication – both active and finished.

When a document is published (approved for publication) it is removed from Drafts and is available on the "Published" tab. Here the options for creating a new draft, unpublishing and Document History are available.

Most headings can be used to sort the list.

Settings for the Controlled Documents library
**********************************************
As a Site Administrator you can set a number of settings for the three lists in the Controlled Documents library.

Don't forget to save when you have changed any settings. The "Save" button is at the very bottom of the window.

Approval Workflow
===========================

When a document has reached a final version, the document must be published, and, if approval is activated, be approved for publication, to be available for readers. The author then starts an Approval Workflow by selecting "Publish".

All metadata must be properly set before the Approval Workflow is started, so the document will be available in the right lists – if applicable. Some metadata can be mandatory. If all mandatory metadata has not been added, the Approval Workflow can not be started.

**Note!**
Metadata can also have impact on who is available as approver.

Any Send for Comments Workflow must be ended before an Approval Workflow can be started.
 
When the author publishes a document, the following is shown:

5.	Select approver from the list.
6.	Enter a due date as information on when you expect the task to be completed.
7.	Select Read rights (see more on that below).
8.	Select conversion to PDF (see more information below).
9.	Click Send.
Regarding Read Rights, the default selection is to use the Default Readers Group from the site’s permissions. You can click Show members to see the permissions. A site administrator (owner) can edit the default read rights.
If, for some reason, the Read Rights for this particular document should be different, you can select Limit Read Access, and enter the names of the readers, or any group memberships, for example AD groups.
Regarding conversion to PDF, an administrator can set how this will work, and it can be different for each Document Type – it can be available or not available. Conversion to PDF is only available for docx documents.
When you click Send, a task is created for the approver, and an e-mail is sent, with a link to the document. Here’s an example:
 
The task can look like this:
 
The approver automatically has read access to the document (note! Read access only), until the task is completed.
If Omnia Intranet is used, the approver is also notified in the notification panel, about the new task, and can choose to open the task from there.
The workflow will be active until the task is completed and the document will be locked for editing during that time.
Approved or Rejected
If the document is approved for publication, it’s now available for readers. You will receive an e-mail stating that.
If it’s rejected, there’s some changes the approver would like you to do. You will receive an e-mail stating that the document was rejected and the e-mail also contains a message from the approver. After you have made the changes, you start a new Publish Workflow the same way as before.

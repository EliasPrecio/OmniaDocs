Review Workflow
===========================

Authors can use the Review Workfloe to get input from one or more colleagues in an organized way, or even to get help to type some part of the text. When the Workflow is active, all users that has been added as reviewers can edit the document, regardless of what access they normally have to the site. If it’s a Microsoft Word document – the option “Track changes” is automatically turned on so all comments/changes can be seen by everyone.

The option is called "Send for Comments workflow" and can be sued as many times as is needed before publication of an edition, but there can only be one such workflow active at a time, for each document. On the other hand, using this the workflow is optional. The author can always choose to publish directly. 

**Note!**
Everyone that is appointed as reviewer automatically receives edit access to the document when the workflow is active, and that access is removed when the colleague’s task is completed. Also note that publication is not allowed while a Review Workflow is active for the document.

To use the Send for Comments Workflow, do the following:
1.	Click the dot menu for the document.
2.	Select Send for Comments.
 
The following is shown:
 
3.	In Reviewers, type the name(s) of the colleagues you will send to. Normally, any colleague can be addressed for comments.
As it is a name field, when you start typing, a list of users corresponding to what you have typed so far, is shown. You can then select a user in the list, or continue typing.
4.	Type a message.
Even if you send to several colleagues, you can only use one message. If what you want different colleagues to do is very different, it may be better to use more than one workflow (but remember that only one workflow can be active at a time, for each document).
5.	Enter a due date as information on when you expect the review to be finished.
6.	Click Send.
A task is created for each colleague, and an e-mail is sent to each, with the message you entered, and with a link to the document. Here’s an example:
 
If Omnia Intranet is installed, the colleagues are also notified in the notification panel, about the new task, and can choose to open the task from there.
The workflow will be active until all tasks are completed, or until you cancel the workflow.
Check status for a Send for Comments Workflow
You can check the status for a workflow any time. Here’s how:
1.	Click the link in the column Status.
 
Something like the following is shown:
 
Here you can see if some reviewers has finished the task, and in that case you can see the comment entered for the task. To see comments and/or changes in the document, you have to open the document.
Cancel a Send for Comments Workflow
If needed, you can always cancel a workflow. The reason could be that you simply have sent to the wrong colleaugues, that you want to end this workflow to start another workflow, or that you will publish the document.
1.	Click the link in the column Status.
 
2.	Click Cancel Send for Comments Workflow.
 
Everyone you sent to are now notified by e-mail that the workflow is cancelled. (And their edit access to the document is also removed.)

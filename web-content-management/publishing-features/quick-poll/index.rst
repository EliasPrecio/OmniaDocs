Through the Quick Poll control a web editor can add a poll on a web page (the questions are created in Omnia Admin, see Quick Polls Administration, below). Quick Polls can be added as a web part to any standard Sharepoint page and as a block to any Quick Page.

Here's an example on how an end users would see a Quick Poll:

**Note!** As usual you must publish the page for any changes to be shown for the users.

When a user has voted, the present result is shown, for example:

**Note!** Whether a user has answered the poll or not is stored as a cookie in the web browser. If another web browser is used or the cookies are cleared, the user will be able to vote again.

Quick Polls Administrattion
*****************************
You use this option in Omnia Admin to create the polls and then any editor can place any active poll on the start page or on any web page in the intranet.

An administrator, and others that are assigned the permissions, can create Quick Polls. Any editor for publishing pages can then add a Quick Poll (or several) to any publisning page. Quick Polls can of course also be added on the start page.

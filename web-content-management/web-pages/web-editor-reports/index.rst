Web Editor Reports
===========================

When "Content Magament" is selected in Omnia Admin, the first page displays an overview over the pages in the Site Collection. Here's an example:

Note the two units "Past review date", one for "your" pages, and one for all other pages. Your pages are all pages where you are the contact person (your name is added in the field "Contact"). By clicking the unit you can see a list of the pages in question. You can even click the link to the page to go there. The field "Review Date" must be activated in "Page Properties" in "Edit Mode" for this to work.

Click for more details. Here's an example from a Past review date report:

**Tip!**: There's also a number of reports available for publishing pages, when you edit a page, see (under "Reports, almost at the end of the page): :doc:`Manage Content </web-content-management/web-pages/manage-content/index>`

Multi Lingual Pages
===========================

In Omnia editors can work with more than  one Language Edition of the content for a page. There's no actual settings specifically for languages in Omnia Admin, but there are some prerequisites:

+ The Omnia Tenant Feature "Omnia Intranet Multi Lingual" must be active.
+ The languages to be used must be defined in the Term Store, under ""Working Languages".
+ If any Page Properties should be shared between languages, you must select "Shared" for these properties under Content Management/Page Properties in Omnia Admin.

**Note!**
This has to do with the content of publishing pages only. Different languages for menus, labels etc are handled through System/Localization.

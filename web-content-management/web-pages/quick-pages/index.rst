Quick Pages
===========================

In Omnia there are two different ways of editing publishing pages: The Sharepoint way and the Omnia way (Quick Edit). The Omnia Quick Edit makes it a lot easier for an editor to edit an existing page, and to create, move and remove pages. In this chapter the Quick Edit option will be described.

Omnia Quick Edit can be started for a publishing page this way: 

+ Browse to a web page and click on the Quick Edit icon next to the page title.

The Quick Edit button is always available for any user that has permissions to edit a certain page. When the icon is used to open Quick Edit for a page, that page is automatically checked out, which means no other editor can edit that page until it's checked in or published.

Tip:
If you just would like to have a look at the settings for a page, without checking out, open the Settings menu (the cogwheel) and select "Manage Content", to open Quick edit.

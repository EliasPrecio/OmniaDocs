Scheduled Publishing
===========================

If Scheduling is activated for the News Site, a "Scheduled" tab is shown.

When you select to activate scheduled publishing for a news page the Publish button is deactivated. You just save the page the normal way. The page then is automatically published the start date and time you have set.
